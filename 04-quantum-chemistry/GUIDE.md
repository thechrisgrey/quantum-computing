## Concepts

### The Electronic Structure Problem

The central problem in computational chemistry: given a molecular geometry (nuclear positions), find the ground state energy and wavefunction of the electrons.

**Why it's hard classically:**
- The exact wavefunction lives in an exponentially large space (2^n for n spin-orbitals)
- Classical methods (DFT, CCSD(T)) use approximations that break down for strongly correlated systems
- Catalysis, drug binding, materials properties often involve strong correlation

**Why quantum computers help:**
- Quantum systems naturally represent exponential spaces
- A quantum state of n qubits can encode a wavefunction of n spin-orbitals
- Polynomial quantum resources for problems requiring exponential classical resources

### Second Quantization

Instead of tracking each electron's position, second quantization uses creation ($a_p^\dagger$) and annihilation ($a_p$) operators for each spin-orbital $p$:

- $a_p^\dagger\ket{0} = \ket{1_p}$ (create an electron in orbital p)
- $a_p\ket{1_p} = \ket{0}$ (remove an electron from orbital p)
- Anticommutation: $\{a_p, a_q^\dagger\} = \delta_{pq}$

The molecular Hamiltonian in second quantization:

$$
H = \sum_{pq} h_{pq}\, a_p^\dagger a_q + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{pqrs} h_{pqrs}\, a_p^\dagger a_q^\dagger a_s a_r
$$

where $h_{pq}$ (one-electron integrals) and $h_{pqrs}$ (two-electron integrals) are computed classically from the basis set and molecular geometry.

### Fermion-to-Qubit Mappings

Quantum computers use qubits, not fermions. We need a mapping that preserves the fermionic anticommutation relations.

**Jordan-Wigner Transformation:**
- Maps occupation of orbital $p$ to qubit $p$: $\ket{0}$ = unoccupied, $\ket{1}$ = occupied
- a_p^dagger -> (X_p - iY_p)/2 * Z_{p-1} * Z_{p-2} * ... * Z_0
- The Z-string encodes fermionic antisymmetry (parity of all lower orbitals)
- Pro: Intuitive mapping. Con: Non-local — operators on orbital p involve all lower qubits.

**Bravyi-Kitaev Transformation:**
- Encodes both occupation and parity information in each qubit
- Results in O(log n) weight operators instead of O(n)
- More efficient for certain circuits but less intuitive

**Parity Mapping:**
- Qubit p stores the parity of orbitals 0 through p
- Can reduce qubit count by 2 using symmetry (total electron number, spin)

**Practical choice:** Jordan-Wigner is standard for small molecules. Bravyi-Kitaev can reduce circuit depth for larger systems.

### Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

VQE is the primary algorithm for quantum chemistry on NISQ devices:

1. **Prepare trial state:** Apply parameterized ansatz U(theta)|0>
2. **Measure energy:** Compute <H> = sum_i c_i * <P_i> where P_i are Pauli terms in the qubit Hamiltonian
3. **Optimize:** Use a classical optimizer to minimize <H> by adjusting theta
4. **Converge:** The minimum of <H> approximates the ground state energy (variational principle guarantees E_VQE >= E_exact)

**The variational principle:** For any trial state |psi(theta)>:
<psi(theta)|H|psi(theta)> >= E_ground

This means VQE always gives an upper bound — we can only improve by finding better parameters.

**Measuring the Hamiltonian:**
The qubit Hamiltonian is a sum of Pauli strings (e.g., ZZII, XYZI, IIXX). Each term requires separate measurement in its eigenbasis. Grouping commuting terms reduces the number of distinct measurements needed.

### Ansatz Design

The ansatz (trial wavefunction circuit) determines VQE's quality:

**Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC):**
- Inspired by classical coupled cluster theory
- UCCSD includes single and double excitations:
  U(theta) = exp(T - T^dagger) where T = T_1 + T_2
  T_1 = sum_{ia} t_ia * a_a^dagger * a_i (singles)
  T_2 = sum_{ijab} t_ijab * a_a^dagger * a_b^dagger * a_j * a_i (doubles)
- Chemically motivated — captures the right physics
- Con: Deep circuits (many CNOT gates), expensive on noisy hardware

**Hardware-Efficient Ansatz (HEA):**
- Layers of single-qubit rotations + entangling gates (CNOTs)
- Not chemically motivated — just explores the Hilbert space
- Pro: Short circuits, works on any hardware topology
- Con: Barren plateaus, may not converge to the right answer

**ADAPT-VQE:**
- Grows the ansatz adaptively by selecting operators with the largest gradient
- Starts with empty circuit, adds one operator at a time
- Finds compact, problem-specific ansatze
- More circuit evaluations during optimization but shorter final circuits

### Basis Sets and Active Space

**Basis sets:** Approximate atomic orbitals with Gaussian functions
- STO-3G: Minimal basis (1 function per orbital). Quick but inaccurate.
- 6-31G: Split-valence. Better for properties.
- cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ: Correlation-consistent. Systematic improvement.

Larger basis = more orbitals = more qubits needed.

**Active space selection:**
For a molecule with many electrons, we can't put all orbitals on the quantum computer. Active space methods:
1. Run a classical calculation (Hartree-Fock) to get molecular orbitals
2. Select a subset of orbitals near the Fermi level (the "active space")
3. Treat active space with VQE, frozen core with classical approximation

Example: For a molecule with 20 electrons in 40 orbitals:
- Full: 80 qubits (40 spatial orbitals x 2 spin)
- Active space (4 electrons, 4 orbitals): 8 qubits — tractable on current hardware

### Applications to Drug Discovery and Biochemistry

**Molecular binding energies:** Calculate how strongly a drug candidate binds to a protein pocket. Requires accurate treatment of electron correlation at the binding interface.

**Reaction mechanisms:** Map energy along a reaction coordinate. Transition states often have strong multireference character — exactly where quantum computers can help.

**Materials design:** Predict properties of novel catalysts, battery materials, superconductors from first principles.

**Current limitations:** Today's quantum computers can handle molecules with ~10-20 qubits accurately. This covers small molecules (H2, LiH, BeH2, H2O) but not drug-sized molecules. The value is in developing methods that will scale to useful size as hardware improves.
