## Concepts

### When to Use Hybrid Jobs

**Use Hybrid Jobs when:**
- Your algorithm requires iterative quantum-classical communication (VQE, QAOA, QML training)
- You need priority QPU access (job tasks jump the queue)
- You want parametric compilation (compile once, vary parameters)
- The computation runs for more than a few minutes
- You need checkpointing, metrics, or reproducible environments

**Use standalone quantum tasks when:**
- You're running a single circuit (no iteration)
- You're exploring/debugging interactively
- You don't need priority access

### Hybrid Job Architecture

A Braket Hybrid Job runs in a managed container on EC2:

1. **You provide:** An algorithm script (entry point), optional hyperparameters, input data
2. **Braket provides:** Container environment, SDK, QPU priority access, metrics pipeline
3. **During execution:** Your script submits quantum tasks that get priority QPU access
4. **After completion:** Results stored in S3, metrics in CloudWatch, logs in CloudWatch Logs

```

| CloudWatch Metrics|
+-------------------+
```

### Priority QPU Access

Tasks submitted from within a Hybrid Job get priority over tasks submitted directly:
- Your job's tasks go to the front of the device queue
- This is critical for iterative algorithms where latency between iterations matters
- Without priority, each iteration might wait minutes/hours in the general queue
- With priority, iterations complete back-to-back

### Parametric Compilation

For variational algorithms, the circuit structure stays the same — only parameters change:

```python
from braket.circuits import Circuit, FreeParameter

theta = FreeParameter("theta")
circuit = Circuit().rx(0, theta).cnot(0, 1)

# First run: compiles and executes
result1 = device.run(circuit, shots=1000, inputs={"theta": 0.5})

# Subsequent runs: skips compilation, only updates parameter
result2 = device.run(circuit, shots=1000, inputs={"theta": 0.7})
```

Parametric compilation saves significant time on hardware that requires transpilation (IQM, Rigetti). The circuit is compiled to native gates once, then only parameter values are updated.

### Job Lifecycle

1. **Create:** `AwsQuantumJob.create(...)` — defines script, device, hyperparameters
2. **Queued:** Job waits for the specified device to become available
3. **Running:** Container spins up, algorithm executes, quantum tasks get priority
4. **Metrics:** Your script logs metrics via `log_metric()` — visible in near-real-time
5. **Checkpointing:** Save intermediate state with `save_job_checkpoint()`
6. **Completion:** Results saved to S3, container terminated
7. **Retrieval:** Download results and artifacts

### Hyperparameters, Inputs, and Outputs

**Hyperparameters:** Key-value pairs passed to your algorithm (e.g., learning_rate, n_layers, n_shots). Accessed via `load_job_checkpoint()` or environment variables.

**Input data:** S3 paths to training data, molecular geometries, or graph structures. Automatically downloaded to the container at runtime.

**Output artifacts:** Files your script writes to the output directory. Automatically uploaded to S3 after completion.

**Metrics:** Numeric values logged during execution (loss, energy, fidelity). Stream to CloudWatch for real-time monitoring.

### Custom Containers

The default Braket container includes the SDK and common packages. For specialized dependencies (custom chemistry libraries, large ML frameworks), build a custom container:

1. Create Dockerfile based on Braket base image
2. Add your dependencies
3. Build and push to Amazon ECR
4. Reference the image URI in `AwsQuantumJob.create(image_uri=...)`

### Cost Management

**Instance selection:**
- `ml.m5.large`: Default, sufficient for most variational algorithms
- `ml.m5.xlarge`: More memory for larger problems
- `ml.p3.2xlarge`: GPU for classical ML components

**Cost controls:**
- Set `max_runtime` to cap job duration
- Use `stopping_condition` to halt based on metrics
- Monitor with CloudWatch alarms
- Set AWS Budget alerts (see infra/ templates)

**Approximate costs:**
- EC2 instance: \$0.10-\$3.00/hour depending on type
- QPU charges: Same per-task and per-shot rates as standalone
- Total: Job instance cost + quantum hardware cost

### PennyLane with Hybrid Jobs

PennyLane integrates naturally with Hybrid Jobs:

```python
import pennylane as qml
from braket.jobs import save_job_result
from braket.jobs.metrics import log_metric

dev = qml.device("braket.aws.qubit", device_arn=os.environ["AMZN_BRAKET_DEVICE_ARN"], ...)

@qml.qnode(dev)
def circuit(params):
    ...

optimizer = qml.AdamOptimizer(stepsize=0.1)
for step in range(100):
    params, cost = optimizer.step_and_cost(circuit, params)
    log_metric(metric_name="cost", value=cost, iteration_number=step)

save_job_result({"optimal_params": params.tolist(), "final_cost": float(cost)})
```

### CUDA-Q Integration

For GPU-accelerated quantum simulation within Hybrid Jobs:
- CUDA-Q provides GPU-based state vector and tensor network simulation
- Dramatically faster for circuits > 20 qubits on simulator
- Use `ml.p3.2xlarge` or `ml.g4dn.xlarge` instances
- Available as a Braket-provided container image
