"""Hybrid quantum-classical training loops for QML models.

Uses PennyLane (default device ``default.qubit``; ``braket.local.qubit``
opt-in via ``device_name``) for analytic gradients — per the project's
"Use PennyLane for variational and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms"
guidance. The previous implementation used raw parameter-shift on Braket
which was O(n_samples * n_params * 2) circuit runs per epoch; this
implementation uses backprop on the local simulator.

The ``shots`` argument is preserved for API compatibility but ignored on
the local simulator — analytic expectation values are used. Pass through
a different entrypoint when targeting QPU hardware.
