## Concepts

### Oracle-Based Algorithms

An oracle is a black-box function f(x) implemented as a quantum gate. Oracle-based algorithms demonstrate quantum speedup by querying the oracle fewer times than any classical algorithm.

**Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm:**
Given f: {0,1}^n -> {0,1} that is either constant (same output for all inputs) or balanced (outputs 0 for half, 1 for half):
- Classical: Need 2^(n-1) + 1 queries in the worst case
- Quantum: Need exactly 1 query

The circuit: Apply H to all qubits, query the oracle, apply H again, measure. If all qubits measure 0, f is constant. Otherwise, f is balanced.

**Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm:**
Given f(x) = s . x (dot product mod 2) for hidden string s:
- Classical: Need n queries to find s
- Quantum: Need 1 query

**Grover's Search Algorithm:**
Given an oracle that marks one item out of N = 2^n:
- Classical: $O(N)$ queries needed
- Quantum: $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries — quadratic speedup

Key steps (one "Grover iteration"):
1. Apply oracle: Flip phase of the marked state
2. Apply diffusion: Reflect about the mean amplitude

Optimal number of iterations: approximately $\tfrac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$

### Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

The QFT is the quantum analogue of the Discrete Fourier Transform. It maps computational basis states to the frequency domain:

$$\text{QFT}\ket{j} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{2\pi i jk/N} \ket{k}$$

**Circuit construction:**
- Apply H to qubit j
- Apply controlled rotations from qubit j to all subsequent qubits
- Repeat for each qubit
- Reverse qubit order (SWAP)

The QFT circuit uses $O(n^2)$ gates for $n$ qubits — exponentially faster than the classical FFT's $O(n \cdot 2^n)$ operations on the amplitudes.

**Applications:** Phase estimation, Shor's algorithm, quantum simulation, amplitude estimation.

### Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)

QPE extracts the eigenvalue of a unitary operator. Given:
- A unitary $U$ with eigenvector $\ket{u}$ such that $U\ket{u} = e^{2\pi i\phi}\ket{u}$
- QPE estimates $\phi$ to $n$ bits of precision using $n$ ancilla qubits

**Circuit:**
1. Prepare ancilla qubits in |+> (Hadamard on each)
2. Apply controlled-U^(2^k) from ancilla k to the eigenstate register
3. Apply inverse QFT to the ancilla register
4. Measure ancilla to get phi in binary

**Why it matters:**
- Foundation of Shor's algorithm (factor integers by finding the period of modular exponentiation)
- Directly used in quantum chemistry (energy eigenvalues of molecular Hamiltonians)
- Core subroutine in many other algorithms

### Variational Algorithms

Variational algorithms use a classical optimizer to tune parameters of a quantum circuit (ansatz) to minimize a cost function. They are the primary approach for NISQ-era quantum advantage.

**Structure:**
1. Choose a parameterized circuit (ansatz) with parameters theta
2. Measure an observable to compute cost C(theta)
3. Use a classical optimizer to update theta to minimize C
4. Repeat until convergence

**QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm):**
Designed for combinatorial optimization (MaxCut, traveling salesman, scheduling).

The QAOA circuit alternates between:
- Cost unitary: e^(-i * gamma * C) where C encodes the problem
- Mixer unitary: e^(-i * beta * B) where B = sum of X gates

With p layers (depth parameter), QAOA has 2p parameters (gamma_1..p, beta_1..p).

**MaxCut example:** Given a graph, partition vertices into two sets to maximize edges crossing between sets. The cost Hamiltonian encodes edge weights as ZZ interactions.

**Classical Optimizers for Variational Algorithms:**
- COBYLA: Gradient-free, good for noisy landscapes
- SPSA: Stochastic gradient approximation, only 2 function evaluations per step
- Adam: Gradient-based (requires parameter-shift rule for gradients), good convergence
- Nelder-Mead: Gradient-free simplex method

### Amplitude Estimation

A generalization of Grover's search that estimates the probability of a good outcome without full search. Provides quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods.

Given oracle A that prepares a state with amplitude sin(theta) on the "good" subspace:
- Classical Monte Carlo: O(1/epsilon^2) samples for precision epsilon
- Quantum Amplitude Estimation: O(1/epsilon) queries — quadratic improvement

Applications: Finance (option pricing), risk analysis, counting problems.
